This is a side project to the *gemi* GameBoy Emulator project.

While the main repository covers the core emulator library, tests 
and desktop UI applications, everything written in pure rust, this
project aims to provide a HTML/CSS/JavaScript based frontend
around a web assembly build of the emulator.

The purpose of this project is to provide a "battery included" online
demo of the emulator, allowing anyone to run the emulator without the 
need to download and compile the project by themselves.

To serve this purpose, the repository also contains some demo ROMs,
which can easily be selected from the emulator's web UI.
